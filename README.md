# Developer's Guide for a Wireless Game

The goal of this projects was to create a fun and interesting project which utilized a variety of different hardware sensors and components, all at a reasonable price. Along with that, I wanted to give readers example code which utilizes current technologies like mesh networks, microcontroller displays, and accelerometers, with intention that you yourself can go off and do amazing things with the technology. In this project, I put a twist on a classic game utilizing armMbed devices and components, and hope that you have as much fun as I did building something similar.

In this project, there are three different [FRDM-K64F](TODO: add link) devices being used. These devices communicate with each other using a newer wireless protocol named Thread, which has recently become an industry standard and is backed by an alliance of big name companies. One device in this project is designated as the master, and is responsible for assigning IP addresses to its slaves and managing all aspects of the game being played.  The remaining slave devices are issued out to game players, and are used like ping-pong paddles. When a user raises and lowers the device, it should mimic a ping-pong paddle attempting to block a ping-pong ball.
